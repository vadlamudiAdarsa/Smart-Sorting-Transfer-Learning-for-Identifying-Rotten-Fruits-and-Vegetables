# Smart-Sorting-Transfer-Learning-for-Identifying-Rotten-Fruits-and-Vegetables
Category: Artificial Intelligence

Skills Required:
Python,Deep Learning

Project Description:

Smart Sorting is an innovative project focused on enhancing the precision and efficiency of detecting rotten fruits and vegetables using cutting-edge transfer learning techniques. By leveraging pre-trained deep learning models and adapting them to specific datasets of fruits and vegetables, this project aims to revolutionize the process of sorting and quality control in the agricultural and food industry.

Scenario 1:

In a large food processing plant, workers manually sort through thousands of fruits and vegetables daily to separate the rotten ones from the fresh produce. This process is time-consuming, prone to human error, and labor-intensive. By implementing a smart sorting system that utilizes transfer learning for image recognition, the plant can automate this task. Cameras installed along the conveyor belts capture images of the produce. The system, trained on a vast dataset of images of both fresh and rotten produce, quickly and accurately identifies and sorts out the rotten items. 

Scenario 2:

Supermarkets receive large shipments of fruits and vegetables, and ensuring the freshness of these products is crucial to maintaining customer satisfaction and reducing waste. A smart sorting system using transfer learning can be deployed at the receiving docks. As the shipments arrive, the system scans the produce in real-time, identifying any rotten items before they are stocked on the shelves. This ensures only fresh produce reaches the consumers, thereby enhancing the store's reputation for quality and freshness. 

Scenario 3:


In modern smart homes, refrigerators equipped with smart sorting technology can help families reduce food waste. Using transfer learning algorithms, cameras inside the fridge continuously monitor the condition of stored fruits and vegetables. The system can alert users via a smartphone app when it detects any items starting to rot, suggesting that they should be consumed soon. This proactive approach helps households manage their food better, reducing waste and saving money.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES

By the end of this project, you will:

Know fundamental concepts and techniques used for Deep Learning.

Gain a broad understanding of data.

Have knowledge of pre-processing the data/transformation techniques on outliers and some visualization concepts

PROJECT FLOW

The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) to choose the image.

The chosen image is analyzed by the model which is integrated with the flask application.

Once the model analyses the input the prediction is showcased on the UI


To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities listed below,

Data Collection: Collect or download the dataset that you want to train.

Data pre-processing

Data Augmentation

Splitting data into train and test

Model building

Import the model-building libraries

Initializing the model

Training and testing the model

Evaluating the performance of the model

Save the model

Application Building

Create an HTML file

Build python code


Project Structure
Create the Project folder which contains files as shown below

We are building a Flask application with HTML pages stored in the templates folder and a Python script app.py for scripting.

Healthy_vs_rotten.h5 is our saved model. Further, we will use this model for flask integration.
