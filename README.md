Project Description:

Smart Sorting is an innovative project focused on enhancing the precision and efficiency of detecting rotten fruits and vegetables using cutting-edge transfer learning techniques. By leveraging pre-trained deep learning models and adapting them to specific datasets of fruits and vegetables, this project aims to revolutionize the process of sorting and quality control in the agricultural and food industry.

Scenario 1:

In a large food processing plant, workers manually sort through thousands of fruits and vegetables daily to separate the rotten ones from the fresh produce. This process is time-consuming, prone to human error, and labor-intensive. By implementing a smart sorting system that utilizes transfer learning for image recognition, the plant can automate this task. Cameras installed along the conveyor belts capture images of the produce. The system, trained on a vast dataset of images of both fresh and rotten produce, quickly and accurately identifies and sorts out the rotten items. 

Scenario 2:

Supermarkets receive large shipments of fruits and vegetables, and ensuring the freshness of these products is crucial to maintaining customer satisfaction and reducing waste. A smart sorting system using transfer learning can be deployed at the receiving docks. As the shipments arrive, the system scans the produce in real-time, identifying any rotten items before they are stocked on the shelves. This ensures only fresh produce reaches the consumers, thereby enhancing the store's reputation for quality and freshness. 

Scenario 3:


In modern smart homes, refrigerators equipped with smart sorting technology can help families reduce food waste. Using transfer learning algorithms, cameras inside the fridge continuously monitor the condition of stored fruits and vegetables. The system can alert users via a smartphone app when it detects any items starting to rot, suggesting that they should be consumed soon. This proactive approach helps households manage their food better, reducing waste and saving money.
